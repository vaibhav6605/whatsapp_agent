# WhatsApp MCP Server

# My name is Vaibhav Chauhan. I am a third year undergraduate in the department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Kanpur.
This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates with WhatsApp.
With it, I can search and read my personal WhatsApp messages â€” including texts, images, videos, documents, and audio messages. I can also look up contacts and send messages to individuals or groups, along with media files of any type.

All messages are stored locally in a SQLite database and are only shared with an LLM (like Claude) when I explicitly access them through tools under my control.
Here's an eample below:
